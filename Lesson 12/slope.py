# Write a function which computes the slope and y-intercept for the line passing through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Use this formula for the slope: (y_1- y_2)/(x_1-x_2 )  and this one for the y-intercept: b = y1 â€“ m*x1. Write a main function which takes the values of x1, y1, x2 and y2 from the user and calls the function, outputting the results to the user.
